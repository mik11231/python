Implementation Notes:
- This module is intentionally documented in depth so the solution can be
  reconstructed from comments/docstrings after long periods away from the code.
- The code follows a parse -> transform -> solve pipeline where applicable.
- Year scope: advent2018.
- Complexity and data-structure tradeoffs are described in function docstrings below.
